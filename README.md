# RayCasting

Description: Path-tracing algorithm with next event estimation. Raycasting with 2D Texture & Motion Blur

Techniques
- Calculations for ray-surfaces intersection of many types of surfaces: explicit, implicit,
procedural, fractal

- Local lighting calculations: Modern micro-facet BRDFs, reflection, refraction, shadowing.

- Global lighting calculations: Indirect calculations via the integral lighting equation.

- The Monte Carlo solution to the integral lighting equation including many importance sampling
techniques, multiple-importance sampling and other performance enhancements.
